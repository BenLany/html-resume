    <h3><li>The Great Outdoors</li></h3>
    <ul>
        <h4><li>Growing up, I spent the vast majority of my time outside; playing in the creek on our old family ranch<br>
            or fishing at the pond that the creek fed into. As I grew up, my father started expanding my interest of<br>
            the outdoors into hunting, which is a hobby and life style that will always be a part of my life.</li></h4>

    <h3><li>Video Games</li></h3>
    <ul>
        <h4><li>Ever since I can remember, I have played video games. Video games are likely the reason that I have<br>
            taken such a huge interest in computers and software and the reason that I have decided to go into<br>
            software developement.</li></h4>
